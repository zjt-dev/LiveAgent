 * (matching the page pipeline's optimistic clear) and the draft is restored
 * when the send is rejected or throws, so no text is ever lost.
 *
 * Attachment-only turns are sendable: ChatComposerBar enables Send when the
 * pane has staged uploads even if the draft is empty, matching the focused
 * pane's `hasSendableDraft` rule.
